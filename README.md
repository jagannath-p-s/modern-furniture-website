## What We Built
We created a modern, easy-to-use website that looks great on everything from phones to desktop computers. The whole project took us one month to complete, and we're pretty proud of how it turned out!

###  Features
- Works smoothly on phones, tablets, and computers
- Super fast loading times
- Easy to navigate menus
- Looks great on all screen sizes
- Modern design that matches Regal's branding


We built this using:
- Good old HTML5 and CSS3
- Some JavaScript magic
- Modern layout techniques (Flexbox and Grid)
- Performance optimizations so everything loads fast
